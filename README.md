# Graph Algorithms Repository

This repository is dedicated to housing a collection of efficient and well-documented graph algorithms implemented in python, developed as part of a course at AGH.

## Contents

1. **Warmup**: Finding the minimum weight edge on a path from source to destination in an undirected graph using find-union structure and Dijkstra's algorithm.

2. **Maximum flow**: Finding the maximum flow in a graph using Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
3. **Minimum cut**: Finding the minimum cut in a graph using Stoer-Wagner algorithm.
4. **Diagonal graphs**: Checking if the given graph is a diagonal graph using LexBFS. Finding the size of the maximum clique, the optimal coloring and the size of the minimum vertex cover of a diagonal graph.

## Usage

Each problem consists of a notebook containing the solution and tests, as well as files containing graphs in DIMACS format. Feel free to test it yourself!
